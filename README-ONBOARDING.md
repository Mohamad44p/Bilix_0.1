# Onboarding Flow Implementation

## Overview

The onboarding flow is designed to guide new users through setting up their organization and AI preferences after signing up. This creates a personalized experience for invoice processing from the start.

## Flow Steps

1. User signs up via Clerk authentication
2. User is automatically redirected to the onboarding page
3. User completes the onboarding steps:
   - Organization details
   - AI preferences
   - Sample invoice uploads
4. Data is saved to the database
5. User is redirected to the dashboard

## Implementation Details

### Database Changes

Added new fields to the Organization model:
- `industry` - String (optional)
- `size` - String (small, medium, large)
- `invoiceVolume` - String (low, medium, high)

To apply these changes, run:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_organization_fields
```
